Introduction
============

KASL is a library that builds support for a lot of tools I find myself
reaching for repeatedly in various projects. It aims to work among the
platforms I commonly use:

+ atmelsamd (e.g. the Feather M0 and M4)
+ esp8266
+ atmega (primary 328p, but nominally includes untested support for 32u4)
